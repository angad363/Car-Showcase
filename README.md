# CarHub - Car Showcase WebApp

CarHub is a web application built using Next.js, React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Typescript. It allows users to search for a variety of cars based on their manufacturer and model. Users can obtain information about the car models they have searched, including mileage, gas type, model year, drive base, and more.

## Features

- Search for cars based on manufacturer and model.
- View detailed information about the car models, including mileage, gas type, model year, drive base, etc.
- Filter cars based on fuel type (gas or electric) and model year (2015 to 2023).
- Display cars using visually appealing car cards.
- Load more cars by clicking the "Show More" button below the car cards.
- The wwebapp is mobile responsive as well.
- Access additional details of a car by clicking the "View More" button on the car card. This provides more information about the car along with a few static images.

**Please note that the API used to generate car images is a paid API, which means specific car images cannot be generated dynamically. As a result, the project includes static images of a particular car for demonstration purposes.**
